# How the Web Works (Basics)

Before writing code, you must understand **how the web actually works**.

## The Big Picture

When a user opens a website:

1. Browser sends a request
2. Server processes it
3. Server sends a response
4. Browser renders the page

This flow happens **every time** you click a link.

## Why This Matters

If you don’t understand this flow:
- APIs feel confusing
- Errors feel random
- Debugging feels impossible

Once you understand it, everything makes sense.
